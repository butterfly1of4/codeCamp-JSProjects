Convert the given number into a roman numeral.

All roman numerals answers should be provided in upper-case.

SYMBOLS:

1 = I
5 = V
10 = X
50 = L
100 = C
500 = D
1000 = M

COMMON COMBINATIONS:
1= I        10=X        100=C
2=II        20=XX       200=CC 
3=III       30=XXX      300=CCC
4=IV        40=XL       400=CD
5=V         50=L        500=D
6=VI        60=LX       600=DC
7=VII       70=LXX      700=DCC
8=VIII      80=LXXX     800=DCCC
9=IX        90=XC       900=CM

When a symbol appears after a larger (or equal) symbol it is added

Example: VI = V + I = 5 + 1 = 6
Example: LXX = L + X + X = 50 + 10 + 10 = 70

But if the symbol appears before a larger symbol it is subtracted

Example: IV = V − I = 5 − 1 = 4
Example: IX = X − I = 10 − 1 = 9

Don't use the same symbol more than three times in a row (but IIII is sometimes used for 4, particularly on clocks)

Remember:

STEPS:

1. Write and establish variables that link each letter with a number.

2. Split each number into 4 pieces:
    -1 -10 -100 -1000

    -write a program that divides num by: num/1000, num/100,num/10,num/1

3. use % mod to establish if there's a remainder on each whole number (100,10,etc)
    -the remainder will act as the difference between 1000's. (10-1=9)ect.
